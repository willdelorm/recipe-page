## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

On this challenge, I opted to use as few class names as possible and stuck to styling based on the HTML elements. This forced me to use pseudo-classes to isolate the last child or every child besides the last one.

I also learned how to re-create the numbers of an ordered list using the pseudo-element `::before` and the CSS properties `counter-reset` and `counter-increment`. It's nice to find that CSS has a way to do this without involving JavaScript.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue learning to use pseudo-classes and -elements in more situations.

### Useful resources

- [W3S Table Styles](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_table.asp) - I had to review styling tables, specifically adding the borders in-between rows
- [W3S Pseudo Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_pseudo_elements.asp) - I always need to reference how to use pseudo elements since I don't use them enough. Glad to find a relatively simple way to customize bullet points!
